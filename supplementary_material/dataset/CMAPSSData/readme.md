Exemplary data for the framework, based on NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation} (C-MAPSS) dataset.

The dataset includes run-to-failure simulated data of turbofan jet engines. Specifically, in our considered dataset FD001, engines are simulated according to a single operating condition (called Sea level) and their failures are attributable to one possible cause (HPC degradation).
Each engine simulation is represented by a multivariate time series, sampled at one value per second, obtained from 21 engine sensors. 
The dataset includes 100 training traces, each ending with a failure, and 100 test traces, each ending an arbitrary and known number of time steps before the failure (gap).
